            <li>When I began learning of programming, the methodology and the way of transferring knowledge in Polish studies did not suit me at all,
                that's why I used Codecademy courses and similar English-language websites more often. Extremely simple and fast way to transfer 
                knowledge were very motivating for me, especially in the early stages of learning. Thanks to this approach, I learned in a very short 
                time specificity of reading a simple code and I was able to independently find mistakes that I have made in the first tasks.</li>
            <li>When I managed to understand a little more the specificity of programming, I also became interested in courses in Polish. I was looking
                for content, which would be legible and easily digestible for me.<br>The material that allowed me to gain some independence was the 
                training available on the platform Udemy.com - "Java from scratch to expert - create your own applications" by Arkadiusz WÅ‚odarczyk. 
                It is a several dozen-hour course that shows step by step basics of programming along with exercises of various difficulty levels, 
                and in my opinion it is a very interesting proposition for people who want to take up learning programming.</li>
            <li>Besides the material mentioned above, I,ve also finished few different courses of <span style="color:cornflowerblue"><strong> Java
                 and MySQL </strong></span> avalaible in the Internet (Codecademy.com and Udemy.com) and I can say that I,m satisfied about my learning
                progresses. Using knowledge that I posessed and support from different programming services in the Internet (as stackoverflow.com), 
                I am able to create simple programs all by myself. </li>
            <li>Now I'm developing my first <span style="color:cornflowerblue"><strong>Java</strong></span> application, and this is so much fun.
                 This is simple program, which arranges a selected mathematical operation from numbers randomly selected by the computer.</li>
            <li>At the same time, I try not to neglect further learning and constantly deepen my knowledge of Java. Wanting to be more versatile,
                I started at the same time also learning of<span style="color:cornflowerblue"><strong>HTML and JavaScript.</strong></span></li>
